## Quick Start

### Docker Deployment (Recommended for Web Version)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd medical-lab-system

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Access the application at http://localhost:5000
```

### Manual Deployment

#### Web Version
```bash
cd final_distribution/web_version
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

#### Desktop Versions
The desktop versions need to be built on their respective platforms:

##### Windows
1. Copy the project to a Windows machine
2. Run: `python build_executables/build_windows.py`
3. Find the executable in `final_distribution/windows_desktop/`

##### macOS
1. Copy the project to a macOS machine
2. Run: `python build_executables/build_macos.py`
3. Find the app bundle in `final_distribution/macos_desktop/`
